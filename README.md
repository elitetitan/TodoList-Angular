A very basic single page web app in angular. You can add items using the input field and clicking the Add Todo button or hitting enter key. Clicking on any individual item in the list will strikethrough the text and mark it as done. You can also remove the item from the list by clicking on the remove button. 

## Running the app

You must have node.js and angular cli installed. The app has been developed using the following versions: Node.js -> 15.4.0 Angular cli -> 11.0.7
Download the files and head to the root folder(the one containing the files) in command line.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
